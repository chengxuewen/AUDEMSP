# Code Edit Safety

> **Target audience**: AI agents editing AUDEMSP source code.
> **Violation of these rules causes token waste from repeated fix cycles.**

## Tool Selection

| Change Size | Tool | Reason |
|-------------|------|--------|
| Rewrite entire function/file | `write` | Guarantees brace balance, no stale lines |
| ≤20 line single-location edit | `edit` | Minimal diff, safe for small changes |
| Structural pattern replacement | `ast_grep_replace` | Syntax-aware, preserves matching |
| Complex multi-file refactor | Delegate to subagent | Isolated context, verify independently |

## Forbidden Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why |
|--------------|-----|
| `sed` for code modification | Quote escaping errors, regex silent failures |
| Multiple sequential `edit` calls without re-reading | Line numbers drift, stale hash IDs |
| Deleting a line by replacing with empty `lines: []` and assuming brace count is still correct | May leave unbalanced braces |
| Appending `}` to "fix" an unclosed delimiter without counting braces first | Masks root cause, may create double-close |

## Verify Immediately

After EVERY code change (edit, write, or ast_grep_replace):

```
Rust:   cargo check -p <crate>       (5-15s)
TS/TSX: npx tsc --noEmit             (3-5s)
YAML:   docker compose config --quiet (compose 文件)
Shell:  bash -n <script>             (脚本)
```

### 批量 edits 数组必须逐操作验证 (PIT-41)

多个 replace 操作引用相邻区域时，边界行号/内容易错位（一个操作可能覆盖另一个操作的保留区域）。每次 edit 调用后立即跑对应格式验证；发现破坏 → 重读文件恢复，不叠加修复。

If verification fails, STOP. Do NOT apply another edit on top. Instead:
1. `git diff` to see what changed
2. If the change is wrong, `git checkout -- <file>` to revert
3. Re-apply the fix correctly

## Brace Safety Checklist

Before marking any multi-line edit complete, verify:
- [ ] Every `{` has a matching `}` at the same indent level
- [ ] Every `(` has a matching `)`
- [ ] Every `[` has a matching `]`
- [ ] No duplicate function definitions or closing braces
- [ ] `cargo check` / `tsc --noEmit` passes

## When to Delegate

Delegate to a `deep` category subagent when:
- The change touches 3+ files
- The change requires understanding cross-module dependencies
- You've failed the same edit 2+ times

The subagent gets a clean context, reads the files fresh, and applies all changes atomically.

## Architectural Decision Gate (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Before implementing ANY architectural change (protocol, data flow, transport mode, API contract):
- **ALWAYS ask the user first** using the `question` tool with explicit options
- **NEVER fall back to an alternative architecture** without user approval
- **NEVER silently switch** from the agreed architecture (e.g., SFU → P2P) even if it seems "easier"
- **NEVER implement a workaround** that changes the system's design without explicit user consent

If the agreed approach fails, report the failure and ask: "方案 X 失败，原因是 Y。建议改用 Z，是否同意？"

## Test Execution Constraint (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

After claiming tests are written or features are working:
- **ALWAYS run the tests** against the live system. Writing test files without executing them is a violation.
- **ALWAYS report actual test output** — pass/fail counts, error messages. Never claim "tests pass" without evidence.
- **E2E tests MUST run against the actual running service**, not mocked endpoints.
- If tests fail, fix them in the same turn. Do not defer to "later".

## Verification Honesty (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- **NEVER claim a feature works based on a partial test.** A Python WS test passing does NOT mean the browser flow works.
- **ALWAYS verify at the actual user-facing layer.** If the feature is browser-based, test in the browser. If it's API-based, test with curl.
- **ALWAYS report exactly what was tested and what was NOT tested.** Example: "Python WS test passed. Browser flow NOT yet verified."
- **NEVER present a component test as end-to-end proof.** Each layer must be verified independently.
- **If you cannot verify at the user-facing layer, say so explicitly.** Do not imply success.

## Feature Flag Discipline

- **ALL required features MUST be in `default` features** in Cargo.toml — never require manual `--features` for core functionality
- **Build commands in docs MUST include all features** — never document `cargo build` without required features
- **Before running server, ALWAYS verify**: `cargo build -p audemsp-server` (with defaults) produces working binary
- **If a feature is optional, it must be explicitly opt-out** (disable with `--no-default-features`)

## Self-Verification Requirement (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- **ALWAYS verify browser-based features yourself using Playwright MCP tools** (`local-playwright_browser_navigate`, `local-playwright_browser_evaluate`, etc.)
- **NEVER ask the user to test what you can test yourself.** If Playwright is available, use it.
- **After fixing a browser bug, ALWAYS re-test in the browser** before reporting the fix.
- **Report the actual browser console output** as evidence of verification.

## User Confirmation Before Edit (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- **NEVER start editing files without explicit user approval.** Describing a plan ≠ approval to execute.
- **When user asks 'what can be done' or 'is it possible to...', they are asking a question, not giving an instruction to edit.** Answer the question. Do NOT edit files.
- **Before editing, present the plan AND use the `question` tool to confirm.** Wait for affirmative response before touching files.
- **Silence / '继续' / timeout ≠ approval.** Only explicit 'yes' / 'do it' / '执行' counts.

## Process Management (shell)

- **NEVER use `pgrep -f` / `pkill -f` with a pattern that matches your own shell command line** (e.g. `pgrep -f "audemsp-host"` from a bash tool whose command string contains that literal) — it kills the shell itself, hanging the tool. Use `pgrep -x <exact-process-name>` (matches process name only, e.g. `audemsp-host`), or exclude own PID.
- **Killing + relaunching in one shell command** can kill the just-started process (SIGTERM/SIGHUP to the process group on tool timeout). Launch with `setsid nohup ... < /dev/null & disown` and verify with `pgrep -x` in a separate call.
- **Port-in-use on relaunch** (e.g. `Failed to bind 0.0.0.0:9801`) almost always means the old process survived the kill — verify with `ss -tlnp | grep <port>` and kill by PID.
- **Container-recreated services lose apt-installed tools** (gdb etc.) — install debug tools in the Dockerfile dev target, not per-container.
