# Code Edit Safety

> **Target audience**: AI agents editing OMSPBase source code.
> **Violation of these rules causes token waste from repeated fix cycles.**

## Tool Selection

| Change Size | Tool | Reason |
|-------------|------|--------|
| Rewrite entire function/file | `write` | Guarantees brace balance, no stale lines |
| ≤20 line single-location edit | `edit` | Minimal diff, safe for small changes |
| Structural pattern replacement | `ast_grep_replace` | Syntax-aware, preserves matching |
| Complex multi-file refactor | Delegate to subagent | Isolated context, verify independently |

## Forbidden Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why |
|--------------|-----|
| `sed` for code modification | Quote escaping errors, regex silent failures |
| Multiple sequential `edit` calls without re-reading | Line numbers drift, stale hash IDs |
| Deleting a line by replacing with empty `lines: []` and assuming brace count is still correct | May leave unbalanced braces |
| Appending `}` to "fix" an unclosed delimiter without counting braces first | Masks root cause, may create double-close |

## Verify Immediately

After EVERY code change (edit, write, or ast_grep_replace):

```
Rust:   cargo check -p <crate>       (5-15s)
TS/TSX: npx tsc --noEmit             (3-5s)
```

If verification fails, STOP. Do NOT apply another edit on top. Instead:
1. `git diff` to see what changed
2. If the change is wrong, `git checkout -- <file>` to revert
3. Re-apply the fix correctly

## Brace Safety Checklist

Before marking any multi-line edit complete, verify:
- [ ] Every `{` has a matching `}` at the same indent level
- [ ] Every `(` has a matching `)`
- [ ] Every `[` has a matching `]`
- [ ] No duplicate function definitions or closing braces
- [ ] `cargo check` / `tsc --noEmit` passes

## When to Delegate

Delegate to a `deep` category subagent when:
- The change touches 3+ files
- The change requires understanding cross-module dependencies
- You've failed the same edit 2+ times

The subagent gets a clean context, reads the files fresh, and applies all changes atomically.

## Test Execution Constraint (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

After claiming tests are written or features are working:
- **ALWAYS run the tests** against the live system. Writing test files without executing them is a violation.
- **ALWAYS report actual test output** — pass/fail counts, error messages. Never claim "tests pass" without evidence.
- **E2E tests MUST run against the actual running service**, not mocked endpoints.
- If tests fail, fix them in the same turn. Do not defer to "later".
